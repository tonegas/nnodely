# Branching and Commits

## Branching Model

- `main` is the default branch
  - Always stable.
  - Always releasable.
  - Protected (no direct commits).
- `dev` is the rolling branch where we put all development not quite stable
yet.
- All work happens on **feature branches**, created from `main`

### Branch Naming
