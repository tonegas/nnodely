## Reporting Issues

If you encounter a bug, have a question, or want to propose an improvement:

- Check existing issues to avoid duplicates
- Open a new issue using **one of our templates**.
- For bugs, include minimal steps to reproduce if possible

## Feature Requests

If you want to propose a big new feature, please do so by opening a
[discussion](https://github.com/tonegas/nnodely/discussions). For small
features you can open an issue (make sure they are small!).

---

## Pull Requests

We follow a lightweight PR process:

1. Keep PRs **small and focused**.
2. Use one of our
   [templates](https://github.com/tonegas/nnodely/docs/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE)
3. Any PR should address an issue directly, so link to it.
4. Make sure tests pass (and add tests when relevant).

Once submitted, your PR will be reviewed as soon as possible.

## What You Can Contribute

We’re happy to accept:

- **Bug fixes** (this helps us the most).
- New features (through discussions, we will accept PRs only with previously
discussed features).
- Examples and applications (we have a
[repository](https://github.com/tonegas/nnodely-applications) for those).

---

## Communication

Please keep discussions respectful and constructive. Questions and early ideas
are welcome — we’d much rather discuss something early than late.
